Responsive Web Design Project
Overview

Create a website that presents a variety of information about a non-English-speaking country (i.e., a country in which English is not an official language) of your choice. The idea is to enable a user to explore different aspects of that country in the form of samples.

The project can be done in groups of 2.
Site Content

Your website must have information in all of the following categories, as well as any other information you wish.

    History - country history, biography of a famous leader, description of an important event, etc.
    Location - world location, country size, borders, etc.
    Important Cities or Regions
    Demographics - population, ethnic groups, religious groups, language groups, etc.
    Climate - weather patterns, seasons, temperatures, etc.
    Famous Landmarks/Sites
    Date and Time - time zones, holidays, etc.
    National Symbols - flags, animals, flowers, etc.
    Famous People - politicians, entertainers, writers, etc.
    Natural Features - forests, rivers, deserts, mountains, etc.
    Culture - music, art, dance, cuisine, crafts, traditional vocations, etc.
    Economy - main industries, trading partners, currency, etc.

Some of the categories above are naturally suitable to textual information (e.g., History, Economy, … ); others to images (e.g., Famous Landmarks, National Symbols, Natural Features, …); others to combinations. You can even include audio and video if you want, but it is not a requirement.
Layout and Design

    You don’t have to organize your site according to the twelve types of content listed above; it can be any organization you want.
    There must be at least five pages.
    There must be a consistent navigation scheme on all pages.
    All pages should use a consistent design scheme - colours, graphics, lines, etc. - so that the user always knows that he/she is on your site.
    At least one page should contain a large amount of text.
    At least one page should contain an image slideshow.

Responsive Design

Your site must be designed for at least three screen sizes: mobile (small), tablet (medium), and desktop (large). The site content must automatically adjust to changing screen sizes.

In addition, you should implement responsive typography, responsive image sizes, and other sizing/layout features that we have learned about in this course. (For example, don’t clutter up the mobile screen with a sidebar; use a drop-down or slide-out instead.)
Bootstrap

Your pages must incorporate at least one example of each of the following Bootstrap components:

    Navigation Panel(s)
    Slideshow/Carousel
    Cards
    Responsive Typography
    Responsive Images
    Drop-down Lists
    Tooltips
    Collapsible Content
