        The flag of Sweden consists of a yellow or gold Nordic Cross on a field of blue. The Nordic Cross design
        traditionally represents Christianity. The design and colors of the Swedish flag are believed to have been
        inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross pattée of
        gold, and modeled on the Danish flag. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since King
        Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.

        The Three Crowns (in Swedish known as the Tre Kronor) is a national emblem of Sweden. It is in the Coat of Arms
        of the Realm of Sweden, specifically the small coat of arms. The emblem is composed of three yellow or gilded
        coronets arranged with two above and one below on a blue background. This emblem has been utilised by Sweden
        since at least 1336. As there are three crowns this has led to speculation about the symbolism:

            </a>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The crowns are representation of the three crowned gods of Uppsala;the city of Uppsala has been the
                seat of a holy place even before the times of Christianity.</li>
            <li>The crowns represent the three areas of Uppland (the area around Uppsala);these areas had the right to
                take part in the election of the king.</li>
            <li>The three crowns are representations of the Three Wise Men (or Holy Kings).</li>
            <li>The crowns are just a representation of the king's power, and the number three is without significance.</li>
            <li>Magnus Eriksson was once king of Sweden. Magnus inherited the crown of Norway from his grandfather
                Haakon V of Norway, and then gained the Swedish crown as his father was the brother of the king of
                Sweden. In the 1330s king Magnus bought Scania from Denmark, and consequently used the title King of
                Sweden, Norway and Scania. The three crowns may represent King Magnus' three kingdoms.</li>

        </div>
        Mother Svea is the female personification of Sweden and a patriotic emblem of the Swedish nation. Mother Svea
        is normally depicted as a powerful female warrior, valkyrie or shieldmaiden, frequently holding a shield and
        standing beside a lion. Svea is a Swedish female personal name which derives from svea, an old plural genitive
        form meaning "of the Swedes" or the Swea. It appears in Svea rike, a translation of the old Swedish word
        Sverige, the Swedish name for Sweden.
        <br><br>
        Mother Svea appeared frequently as a national symbol in 19th-century Swedish literature and culture. She
        appeared on various Swedish banknotes for over seventy years, such as both the 5-kronor banknote printed
        between 1890–1952 and the 5-kronor banknote printed between 1954-1963.

        Sweden's Royal Regalia are kept deep in the vaults of the Royal Treasury, underneath
        the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum that is open to the public. The crowns and coronets have not been
        worn by Swedish royalty since 1907, but they are still displayed at weddings, christenings and funerals.
        <br><br>
        Prior to 1907, the crowns and coronets were worn along with royal mantles by the king and other princes at the
        monarch's coronation, during the opening of the Riksdag, and displayed on other occasions. After the death of
        Oscar II (the last to be crowned) in 1907, the practice of wearing the crowns at the opening of the Riksdag
        ceased and the crowns would subsequently no longer be worn. After this, the crown of the King and his sceptre
        were simply displayed on cushions on either side of the silver throne while the king's mantle was draped over
        it. The old opening of state would last until 1974.
        <br><br>
        Among the oldest priceless objects are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King
        Erik XIV.
        <br><br>
        On July 31, 2018, thieves stole the crowns and one orb and escaped on a speedboat. The lost regalia were
        found on February 5, 2019 in Åkersberga, Österåker municipality. Funerary regalia over the sarcophagus of King
        Eric XIV in Västerås Cathedral were also stolen in 2013, but were
        soon found and are now on display in a special case there.

        Torbjörn, full name Torbjörn Lindholm, is a dwarfish Swedish engineer and weapons designer, and a founding
        member of Overwatch. His armor comes equipped with a mobile forge, and he carries a Rivet Gun that shoots
        molten slag and a Forge Hammer for construction and melee attacks. His Deploy Turret allows him to toss a
        turret a short distance away, which will then self-deploy before targeting and firing on any opponent in its
        sights. His Overload ability briefly increases his armor, and improves his speed and attack attributes for a
        short amount of time. His ultimate abilitiy Molten Core allows him to shoot up to ten globs of molten metal on
        the ground, damaging any opponent that crosses through them.
        <br><br>
        Torbjörn is voiced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Silverstein" target="_blank">Keith
