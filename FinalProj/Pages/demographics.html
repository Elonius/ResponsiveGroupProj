        The total resident population of Sweden was 10,223,505 on 30 November 2018. The population exceeded 9 million
        for the first time on approximately 12 August 2004 and 9.5 million in the spring of 2012, according to
        Statistics Sweden. The population density is 22.5 people per km² (58.2 per square mile) and it is substantially
        higher in the south than in the north. About 85% of the population live in urban areas. The capital city
        Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in
        the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. Greater Gothenburg
        counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the Öresund.
        <br><br>
        Norrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5
        people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low
        population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Småland. An
        area known as Finnveden, which is located in the south-west of Småland, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can
        also be considered as almost empty of people.
        <br><br>
        Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population, emigrated to
        North America, and most of them to the United States. There are more than 4.4 million Swedish Americans
        according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate. In Canada, the community of Swedish ancestry is 330,000
        strong.
        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <h2 id="language">Language</h2><br>
        The official language of Sweden is Swedish, a North Germanic language, related and very similar to Danish and
        Norwegian, but differing in pronunciation and orthography. Norwegians have little difficulty understanding
        Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than Norwegians. The same goes for
        standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish. The dialects spoken in
        Scania, the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because the region traditionally was a
        part of Denmark and is nowadays situated closely to it. Sweden Finns are Sweden's largest linguistic minority,
        comprising about 5% of Sweden's population, and Finnish is recognised as a minority language. About 200
        languages are now spoken in Sweden, owing to immigrants and refugees.

        <h2 id="health">Health</h2>
        <br>
        Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries
        with respect to low infant mortality. It also ranks high in life expectancy and in safe drinking water. A
        person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a
        specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an
        elective care option. The health care is governed by the 21 landsting of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes,
        with nominal fees for patients.

        Immigration has been a major source of population growth and cultural change throughout much of the history of
        Sweden, and in recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration, ending after
        World War I, to a nation of net immigration, from World War II onwards. The economic, social, and political
        aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants,
        settlement patterns, impact on upward social mobility, crime, and voting behaviour.
        <br><br>
        There are no exact numbers on the ethnic background of migrants and their descendants in Sweden because the
        Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity. This is, however, not to be confused with the
        migrants' national backgrounds, which are recorded.
        <br><br>
        In 2016, there were 2,320,302 inhabitants of a foreign background (foreign-born and children of international
        migrants), comprising around 23% of the Swedish population. The number of people with at least one
        foreign parent was 3,060,115, which counts for 30% of the population. Of these inhabitants, 1,784,497
        persons living in Sweden were born abroad. In addition, 535,805 persons were born in Sweden to two parents born
        abroad and another 739,813 persons had one parent born abroad (with the other parent born in Sweden).
        <br><br>
        According to Eurostat, in 2010, there were 1.33 million foreign-born residents in Sweden, corresponding to
        14.3% of the total population. Of these, 859,000 (9.2%) were born outside the EU and 477,000 (5.1%) were born
        in another EU Member State.
