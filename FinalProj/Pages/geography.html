        Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the Baltic Sea and Gulf of Bothnia, providing a long
        coastline, and forms the eastern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula. To the west is the Scandinavian mountain
        chain (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from Norway. Finland is located to its north-east. It has
        maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, Poland, Russia, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and it is also linked to
        Denmark (south-west) by the Öresund Bridge. Its border with Norway (1,619 km long) is the longest uninterrupted
        border within Europe.
        <br><br>
        Sweden lies between latitudes 55° and 70° N, and mostly between longitudes 11° and 25° E (part of Stora Drammen
        island is just west of 11°). At 449,964 km2 (173,732 sq mi), Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the
        world,[77] the 4th-largest country entirely in Europe, and the largest in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation
        in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near Kristianstad, at −2.41 m (−7.91 ft) below sea level. The
        highest point is Kebnekaise at 2,111 m (6,926 ft) above sea level.

        About 15 percent of the country lies within the Arctic Circle. From about late May until mid-July, sunlight
        lasts around the clock north of the Arctic Circle, but, even as far south as Stockholm, the nights during this
        period have only a few hours of semidarkness. In mid-December, on the other hand, Stockholm experiences only
        about 5.5 hours of daylight; in areas as far north as Lappland, there are nearly 20 hours of total darkness
        relieved by a mere 4 hours of twilight.
        <br><br>
        Considering its northerly geographic location (at the latitude of parts of Greenland and Siberia), Sweden
        enjoys a favourable climate. From the southwest, Atlantic low-pressure winds blow in air warmed by the North
        Atlantic Current and make the weather mild but changeable. Another type of influence comes from continental
        high pressures to the east. These create sunny weather, which is hot in summer and cold in winter.
        <br><br>
        The north-to-south extension of the country and the higher elevation of the northern part results in great
        regional differences in winter climate. The northern interior receives heavy snowfall for up to eight months of
        the year and has severe temperatures that drop as low as −22 to −40 °F (−30 to −40 °C).
        <br><br>
        In southern Sweden, winters vary more from year to year than in the north; snowfall is irregular, and average
        January temperatures range between 23 and 32 °F (−5 and 0 °C). Coastal waters seldom freeze.
        <br><br>
        Summer temperatures vary far less, although summer is much shorter in the north. In terms of average daily
        temperature, “spring” arrives in Skåne during February but not until late May in northernmost Norrland; then it
        may come virtually overnight. Late summer and autumn are the rainiest seasons, but precipitation falls
        throughout the year. Annual precipitation averages about 24 inches (600 mm).

        <h4>1. Stockholm</h4>

        Stockholm is Sweden's capital and biggest city. The city spreads out across 14 islands which are located on the
        southeast coast of Sweden. The city is also the political, economic, cultural, and media capital of the nation
        and accounts for one-third of the country’s GDP. Stockholm’s GDP per capita is one of the highest in Europe.
        The city is also regarded as a global city. Some top ranking European universities like the Royal Institute of
        Technology, Stockholm School of Economics, and others are based in this city. The annual Nobel Prize ceremonies
        are hosted in Stockholm. The Swedish government and many of its numerous agencies are based in the city. The
        Stockholm metro has well-decorated stations and regarded as the longest art gallery in the world. The Stockholm
        Palace in the city serves as the official residence of the monarch of the country. <br><br>
        <h4>2. Gothenburg</h4>

        Ranking second among the biggest cities in Sweden is Gothenburg, a city on the west coast of Sweden by the
        Kattegat. In 1621, the city was founded by King Gustavus Adolphus. The Port of Gothenburg is the biggest port
        in the Nordic countries. The presence of well-known universities like the University of Gothenburg attracts a
        large number of students to this city. The Göteborg Landvetter Airport and the Göteborg City Airport serves the
        city and its people. The Gothenburg Film Festival held in January every year is the largest Scandinavian film
        festival which attracts more than 155,000 visitors annually. <br><br>
        <h4>3. Malmö</h4>

        Malmö is Sweden’s third biggest city and the 6th biggest among the Nordic nations. It is the cultural and
        economic center of South Sweden. Though Malmö was one of most industrialized towns of Scandinavia it struggled
        to adapt to post-industrialism. The city has attracted many biotech and IT companies in recent years and has
        undergone some major architectural developments. Numerous historic buildings and parks are also part of this
        city.<br><br>
        <h4>4. Uppsala</h4>

        Uppsala is the capital of Sweden’s Uppsala County and is an ecclesiastical center of Sweden. It has been the
        seat of the Archbishop of the Church of Sweden. Uppsala University that was founded in 1477 is Scandinavia’s
        oldest center of higher education. The Celsius temperature scale was invented at this university.<br><br>
        <h4>5. Västerås</h4>

        Västerås ranks fifth among the biggest cities in Sweden and is located on the shore of Lake Mälaren in central
        Sweden. The city has a large number of industries and is also a logistics and retailing city.
