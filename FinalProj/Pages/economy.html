        Sweden is the sixteenth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP (gross domestic product) per capita and a
        high standard of living is experienced by its citizens. Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy. Timber,
        hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy with a heavy emphasis on foreign trade.
        Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports, while telecommunications, the automotive
        industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Sweden is the ninth-largest arms
        exporter in the world. Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and employment. The country ranks among the highest
        for telephone and Internet access penetration.
        <br><br>
        Sweden maintains its own currency, the Swedish krona (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the euro in
        a referendum. The Swedish Riksbank—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently
        focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2%. According to the Economic Survey of Sweden 2007 by
        the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the
        mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.

        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <h2 id="taxes">Taxes</h2><br>
        On average, 27% of taxpayer's money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police
        and military, and 42% to social security.
        <br><br>
        The typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the tax wedge. Total tax collected by Sweden
        as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990. The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in
        1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over
        time. Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax
        rates for the highest income earners dropping the most. In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected
        as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.

        <h2 id="transport">Transport</h2><br>
        Sweden has 162,707 km (101,101 mi) of paved road and 1,428 km (887 mi) of expressways. Motorways run through
        Sweden and over the Øresund Bridge to Denmark. New motorways are still under construction and a new motorway
        from Uppsala to Gävle was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish)
        from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right-hand traffic
        in 1955, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in
        Swedish as Dagen H.
        <br><br>
        The Stockholm metro is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations.
        The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest
        operators are still owned by state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local
        trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include SJ, Veolia
        Transport, DSB, Green Cargo, Tågkompaniet and Inlandsbanan. Most of the railways are owned and operated by
        Trafikverket. Most tram nets were closed in 1967, as Sweden changed from left-side to right-side driving, but
        they survived in Norrköping, Gothenburg and Stockholm. A new tram line is set to open in Lund in 2019.

        <h2 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h2><br>
        Manufacturing is export-oriented and produces the bulk of Sweden’s export income. Nevertheless, the number of
        workers employed in private industry is smaller than the number of public employees.
        <br><br>
        Sweden is a major world exporter of forest products. Timber is transported via a dense road and rail network.
        Sawmills and pulp and paper factories process the forest products. Swedish manufacturers produce a variety of
        wood products, including paper, boards, and prefabricated houses and furniture. The pulp and paper industry
        developed originally at the mouths of rivers along the Gulf of Bothnia and Lake Väner. More recently, plants
        have been located on the coasts of southern Sweden.
        <br><br>
        Sweden’s metal industry still follows a pattern established during the days when waterpower and forestland
        (yielding charcoal fuel) determined the location of iron mills. The iron and steel industry is thus still
        largely found in the Bergslagen region of central Sweden. The iron and steel mills built in the 20th century,
        at Oxelösund and Luleå, are located on the coast.
        <br><br>
        Privately owned firms currently produce about nine-tenths of industrial output. Engineering, including the
        automotive industry, is by far the largest manufacturing industry, producing about half of industrial value
        added. The automotive and aerospace industries have their main plants in south-central Sweden. Swedish
        automakers Volvo and Saab enjoyed strong international reputations into the early 21st century (in 2011 Saab
        declared bankruptcy, but most of its assets were purchased by the start-up company Nartional Electric Vehicle
        Sweden [NEVS]).
        <br><br>
        The electric and electronics industry is concentrated in Stockholm and Västerås. Stockholm is a leading centre
        for the production of communications equipment. The small metal- and plastic-processing industries, with
        centres in the forested areas of southern Sweden, have, like the glassware industry, maintained their vitality
        through flexibility and continued creativity. Stenungsund on the west coast is a centre for the petrochemical
        industry. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are rapidly expanding fields, located near leading
        medical research centres. The construction sector and the food-processing industry also play increasingly
        important roles. Sweden also has an advanced war matériel industry.
        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <h2 id="trade">Trade</h2><br>
        Exports account for about one-third of Sweden’s GDP. The emphasis has shifted from export of raw materials and
        semimanufactured products (pulp, steel, sawn wood) to finished goods, dominated by engineering products (cars,
        telecommunications equipment, hydroelectric power plant equipment) and, increasingly, high technology and
        chemical- and biotechnology. Together, Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland, and Denmark account for
        about two-fifths of Sweden’s export market.

        Imports are more diversified than exports. Before the 1980s petroleum was the single most important import,
        accounting for more than one-fourth of the total value. In 1990 petroleum accounted for less than 5 percent of
        the total. Almost half comes from the import of engineering products (including motor vehicles, business
        machines, and computer equipment). Among the imported foodstuffs are coffee, tea, fruit, and fish. Chemicals
        and textiles are other groups of imported goods. Germany is the main supplier of Sweden’s imports, followed by
        Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the United Kingdom.
