        <span class="startFont">Sweden</span>, located on the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe. The
        name Sweden was
        derived from the Svear, or Suiones, a people mentioned as early as 98 ce by the Roman author Tacitus. The
        country’s ancient name was Svithiod. Stockholm has been the permanent capital since 1523. Sweden occupies the
        greater part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, which it shares with Norway. The land slopes gently from the high
        mountains along the Norwegian frontier eastward to the Baltic Sea. Geologically, it is one of the oldest and
        most stable parts of the Earth’s crust. Its surface formations and soils were altered by the receding glaciers
        of the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Lakes dot the fairly flat landscape, and
        thousands of islands form archipelagoes along more than 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of jagged, rocky coastline. Like
        all of northwestern Europe, Sweden has a generally favourable climate relative to its northerly latitude owing
        to moderate southwesterly winds and the warm North Atlantic Current.

        The country has a 1,000-year-long continuous history as a sovereign state, but its territorial expanse changed
        often until 1809. Today it is a constitutional monarchy with a well-established parliamentary democracy that
        dates from 1917. Swedish society is ethnically and religiously very homogeneous, although recent immigration
        has created some social diversity. Historically, Sweden rose from backwardness and poverty into a highly
        developed postindustrial society and advanced welfare state with a standard of living and life expectancy that
        rank among the highest in the world.
        <br><br>
        Sweden long ago disavowed the military aggressiveness that once involved its armies deeply in Europe’s
        centuries of dynastic warfare. It has chosen instead to play a balancing role among the world’s conflicting
        ideological and political systems. It is for this reason that Swedish statesmen have often been sought out to
        fill major positions in the United Nations. At peace since 1814, Sweden has followed the doctrine, enunciated
        in every document on foreign policy since World War II, of “nonalignment in peace aiming at neutrality in war.”

        <h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>
        <br>
        Sweden's prehistory begins in the Allerød oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC, with
        Late Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the
        country's southernmost province, Scania. This period was characterised by small bands of
        hunter-gatherer-fishers using flint technology.
        <br><br>
        Sweden is first described in a written source in Germania by Tacitus in 98 AD. In Germania 44 and 45 he
        mentions the Swedes (Suiones) as a powerful tribe (distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for
        their powerful fleets) with ships that had a prow at each end (longships). Which kings (kuningaz) ruled these
        Suiones is unknown, but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back
        to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic script was in use among the south
        Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman
        Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south
        Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other North Germanic
        languages.
        <br><br>
        In the 6th century Jordanes names two tribes living in Scandza, both of which are now considered to be
        synonymous with the Swedes: the Suetidi and Suehans. Suetidi is considered to be the Latin form of Svíþjóð, the
        Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the Suetidi and Dani as being of the same stock and the
        tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.
        The Suehans were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes,
        had very fine horses, similar to those of the Thyringi of Germania (alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae
        velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis). The Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson also wrote that the Swedish
        king Adils (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.

        <h2 id="viking">The Vikings</h2>
        <br>
        The Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish
        Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus,
        Ukraine, the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad. Their routes passed through the Dnieper south to
        Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids. The Byzantine Emperor Theophilos noticed their great
        skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard. The Swedish
        Vikings, called Rus are believed to be the founding fathers of Kievan Rus'. The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan

            </a>
        </div>
        described these Vikings as follows:<br><br>
        <cite>Ale's Stones<br>

            "I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil. I have never seen
            more
            perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but
            the

            men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword,
            and
            a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort."</cite>
        <br><br>
        The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden, such as the Greece
        runestones and the Varangian runestones. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards,
        which are commemorated on stones such as the England runestones. The last major Swedish Viking expedition
        appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of Ingvar the Far-Travelled to Serkland, the region south-east of
        the Caspian Sea. Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar runestones, none of which mentions any survivor.
        What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.

        <h2 id="worldwar">World War I & World War II</h2>
        <br>
        Sweden was officially neutral during World War I, although, under German pressure, they did take steps which
        were detrimental to the Allied powers including mining the Øresund channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping,
        and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their
        overseas embassies. Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the White Guards alongside the Germans
        against the Red Guards and Russians in the Finnish Civil War, and briefly occupied the Åland Islands in
        co-operation with Germany.<br>

        </div><br>
        As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during World War II, although its neutrality
        during World War II has been disputed. Sweden was under German influence for much of the war, as ties
        to the rest of the world were cut off through blockades. The Swedish government felt that it was in no
        position to openly contest Germany, and therefore made some concessions. Sweden also supplied steel and
        machined parts to Germany throughout the war. The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the
        Winter War and the Continuation War by allowing volunteers and materiel to be shipped to Finland. However,
        Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped rescue Danish Jews from deportation
        to Nazi concentration camps.
        <br><br>
        During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among
        them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the Swedish rescue missions to
        internment camps and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the Nordic countries
        and the Baltic states. The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues ensured the safety of tens
        of thousands of Hungarian Jews. Nevertheless, both Swedes and others have argued that Sweden could have
        done more to oppose the Nazis' war efforts, even if it meant increasing the risk of occupation.
        <br>
        <hr><br>
        <h2 id="recent">Recent History</h2>
        <br>
        In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013 it
        was estimated that 15 per cent of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5 per cent of the
        population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges.
        Violent incidents have periodically occurred including the 2013 Stockholm riots which broke out
        following the police shooting of an elderly Portuguese immigrant. In response to these violent events, the
        anti-immigration opposition party, the Swedish Democrats, promoted their anti-immigration policies, while the
        left-wing opposition blamed growing inequality caused by the centre-right government's socioeconomic
        policies. <br><br>

        In 2014, Stefan Löfven (Social Democrats) won the General Election and became the new Swedish Prime Minister.
        The Sweden Democrats held the balance of power and voted the government's budget down in the Riksdag, but due
        to agreements between the government and the Alliance, the government was able to hang onto power. Sweden
        was heavily affected by the 2015 European migrant crisis, eventually forcing the government to tighten
        regulations of entry to the country, as Sweden received thousands of asylum seekers and migrants predominantly
        from Africa and the Middle East per week in autumn, overwhelming existing structures.
